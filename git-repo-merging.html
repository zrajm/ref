<h1>Merging One Git Repo into Another</h1>

<p>After working with two separate git reposes for a while, I realized that
they actually belonged together, and that the contents of one of the reposes
actually should just reside in a subdirectory in the other one. After asking
around, and experimenting quite a bit I figured out how to do this, and so I
write this as a reminder, should I ever have to do this again. (Needless to
say, if you intend to follow these instructions, make backups of your
reposes.)</p>


<h2>Fetch the repo to be included</h2>

<p>First we need to get the data from the repo we&rsquo;re about to include.
We&rsquo;ll put it into a separate branch (imaginativelly called
&ldquo;newbranch&rdquo; here) of our main repo.</p>

<pre>
git fetch /path/to/repo/to/include master:newbranch
</pre>


<h2>Move fetched stuff into its own subdir</h2>

<p>Now, if we wanted, we could simply checkout this new branch, move all files
in it into a subdirectory using <code>git mv</code> and thereafter do a
merge&mdash;but then we&rsquo;d loose all the log history of those files
(actually, it&rsquo;d still be there, but <code>git log FILENAME</code>
wouldn&rsquo;t give it to us since it doesn&rsquo;t follow file name changes).
So, to avoid this, let&rsquo;s do a little bit of history re-engineering on
this &ldquo;newbranch&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This magic isn&rsquo;t mine, but actually comes from <code>git help
filter-branch</code> (search for &ldquo;move the whole tree into a
subdirectory&rdquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s at the very end of the page).
This&rsquo;ll move all contents into the newly fetched &ldquo;newbranch&rdquo;
into a single subdirectory called &ldquo;old&rdquo;.</p>

<pre>
SUBDIR_NAME=old
BRANCH_NAME=newbranch
git filter-branch --index-filter \
    'git ls-files -s | \
        sed "s-\t-&amp;'"$SUBDIR_NAME"'/-" | \
        GIT_INDEX_FILE=$GIT_INDEX_FILE.new git update-index --index-info &amp;&amp; \
        mv $GIT_INDEX_FILE.new $GIT_INDEX_FILE
    ' "$BRANCH_NAME"
</pre>

<p>(If the above results in a &ldquo;Cannot rewrite branch(es) with a dirty
working directory.&rdquo; error, then make sure your working directory is
clean&mdash;i.e. that <code>git status</code> reports &ldquo;nothing to
commit&rdquo;.)</p>


<h2>Merge fetched stuff into main branch</h2>

<p>Now we only need to merge &ldquo;newbranch&rdquo; into our main branch and
remove it as a separate branch from our repository. Like so:</p>

<pre>
git merge newbranch
git branch -d newbranch   # optional, removes newbranch
</pre>


<h1>Thanxes</h1>

<p>Thanx to Grum on the <code>#git</code> IRC channel (on freenode), for
pointing me in the right direction, and thanx
to <a href="http://n2.nabble.com/Merging-repositories-and-their-histories-td731202.html">Merging
repositories and their histories</a> for being the right direction into which I
was pointed.</p>
